Rather late, I came across ths really [nice piece in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/08/ai-job-loss-human-enhancement-google/683963/) by Google's James Manyika and economist David Autor about the industry's fixation on the potential of AI to automate whole jobs.

Here's the crux of it:

"We should insist on AI that can collaborate with doctors, teachers, lawyers, building contractors, and others—instead of AI that aims to automate them out of a job."

I won't try any harder to summarize the article, you can go and read it yourself for free. The point is that claims about AI replacing whole professions 1) overestimate the present capabilities of AI to perform complex, real-world tasks and 2) underestimate the complexity of human interactions and contextual awareness that most jobs require.

Not to say that radical automation isn't on the horizon. But between now and then, the most useful application of AI will be in simply helping people do their jobs better.

Because let's face it: every job, no matter how creative or intellectually demanding, involves at least some tasks that are boring and repetitive. By automating many (perhaps even most) of these, AI should allows people to focus on higher-value, more rewarding work. I’ve certainly seen this in my own experience and I know I'm not alone.

This is great news! We should all be excited about the prospect of our jobs sucking less. And yet, so much of the narrative around AI is riddled with the anxiety of people who are practically counting down the days until they get replaced by ChatGPT.

Much of that anxiety is the by-product of hubris from Silicon Valley fundraisers, who have every incentive to be as absolutist as possible. Their AI-powered app is going to whipe out software engineering, replace your lawyer, do all of your accounting and even sing your kids to sleep. In the meantime, your job now is mainly to write prompts, unless you have an actual skill like woodworking or plumbing, which will be a nice career until robots figure that out too.

Obviously, the only jobs that will be around after that will belong to VCs, startup founders and thought leaders.

This dystopian scenario might even sound plausible, but only if you assume that everything else about life and work stays the same. And there's no reason to expect that to happen. Why would it? A world in which lawyers are ten times as productive might just end up being a world in which there's ten times more work for lawyers to do.

[Research shows](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/834231623049152769/pdf/Global-Productivity-Trends-Drivers-and-Policies.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that rising productivity tends to increase demand. For what, exactly? Who knows? But to claim that AI will eliminate intellectually demanding jobs betrays a startling lack of imagination about what people can create when they have more time and freedom.

All of this is to say: instead of preaching doom for entire professions, the real opportunity lies in applying AI—with humility and deliberation—to the specific frictions within each field, so that all of us can spend more time doing what we love.
